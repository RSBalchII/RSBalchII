Certified Data Scientist and AI Systems Architect specializing in the design, development, and optimization of production-grade, multi-agent AI systems. I build the complete end-to-end ecosystem, from the back-end cognitive architecture to the advanced, local-first clients that interact with them.

### üöÄ What I'm Building

I am the architect and lead developer of a comprehensive, local-first AI ecosystem designed for advanced development workflows.

  <strong>üß† External Context Engine (ECE) &mdash; The Cognitive Backend</strong>
</summary>

<br>

The ECE is a novel cognitive architecture featuring a tiered multi-agent system (Python, FastAPI) designed to provide persistent memory and context management for AI applications. It enables long-term reasoning and relationship recall without cloud dependencies.

-   **Core Architecture:** Designed the "Memory Cortex" using **Neo4j** for the knowledge graph (long-term memory), **Redis** for context caching (short-term memory), and specialized agents (Distiller, Archivist, QLearning) for intelligent data processing.
-   **On-Demand LLM Execution:** Implemented a `ModelManager` for on-demand LLM execution (supporting `llama.cpp` (GGUF), Ollama), optimizing resource usage by dynamically starting/stopping models while preserving an externalized persona (POML/JSON).
-   **Advanced Reasoning:** Engineered a **Markovian Thinking** architecture for deep reasoning, decoupling thinking length from context size via fixed-size chunks and textual state carryover.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Integrated performance optimization using **C++/Cython** for critical components identified via profiling (cProfile/snakeviz), achieving significant speedups in Q-table updates and pathfinding.

  <strong>‚å®Ô∏è Forge-CLI &mdash; The Developer's AI Terminal</strong>
</summary>

<br>

Forge-CLI is a local-first AI command-line tool (built with Python and Textual) that serves as an advanced development workflow assistant and the primary client for the ECE.

-   **Local-First Model Interface:** Engineered a multi-provider model interface prioritizing local-first execution (`llama.cpp`, Ollama, Docker Desktop Model Runner) with on-demand loading and full session context preservation via Redis.
-   **Decentralized Tooling:** Implemented a decentralized **UTCP (Universal Tool Calling Protocol)** client for dynamic tool discovery and execution, enabling seamless, namespaced communication with ECE agents (e.g., `filesystem.read_file`).
-   **Intelligent Automation:** Developed a tool automation layer with a pattern-based keyword detector to automatically execute tools from natural language prompts and enhance context before model processing.
-   **Developer-Centric Tools:** Integrated advanced tools, including a Git component for repository analysis and an **AST-based code analyzer** for Python.
